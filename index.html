               <p>MadGalactic started out as a social media handle, but as my interest
                  in design and development have expanded, its become  representative of 
                  the work I hope to do. The name is inspired by a few things.</p>

               <p>First, the obvious. I've had a ton of nicknames growing up because 
                  there's a lot of potential for play with my name, so it was only natural

            <p>I love everything that has to do with outer space. I think I've watched 
               all of the space documentaries available on all major streaming services. 
               The cosmos are so much more interesting to me than anything going on here 
               on Earth, if I would've been better at math as a kid I would've pursued 
               theoretical physics or cosmology</p>

            <p>The song <em>Mad Solar</em>by Kid Cudi is one of my favorites. He's without a doubt one of 
               my favorite artists and I've always identified with the references to space

               In April 2023 I officially filed for my LLC and by the end of this course, I 
               hope to put together what I know about design, development, and branding to launch 
               a media company meant to reach the cosmos. </p>
